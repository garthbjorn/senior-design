# AGP Senior Design Project
This is the repository being used for the AGP code development. Development
is broken down into two distinct projects. In this directory you can see the
projects mainController and slaveController. These will allow for development
on the LPC 4088 Display Module and the STM32F0 respectively.
## mainController
The EA LPC 4088 Display Module is the main controller and it has been developed
in LPCXpresso IDE for compiling and the programming has been done using the 
mbed Drag and Drop binary flashing. 
## slaveController
The STM32F0 is the slave controller and development for this device was performed
in Keil uVision 5 from ARM. Programming was performed over USB.
